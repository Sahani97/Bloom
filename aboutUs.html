                <h1>Welcome to <span class="bloom">Bloom</span></h1>

                <p>At <b>Bloom</b>, we are passionate about bringing the beauty, serenity, 
                    and vitality of nature into your home. We believe that plants are 
                    more than just decoration — they are a source of life, calmness, 
                    and joy. Our goal is to make plant care simple, accessible, and 
                    enjoyable for everyone, whether you're a seasoned plant enthusiast 
                    or just starting your journey with greenery.

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Bloom</b> was founded on the idea that every home deserves a touch of nature. 
                    In a world where we are constantly surrounded by technology and fast-paced 
                    living, we wanted to create a space where people can reconnect with nature, 
                    even in the smallest of ways. We understand the struggles of plant 
                    care—watering schedules, finding the right lighting, and keeping plants 
                    thriving—so we set out to provide expert advice, curated products, and 
                    inspiration to make plant parenting easier for everyone.

                    What started as a simple love for houseplants has grown into a thriving 
                    community of plant lovers who are eager to learn, share, and cultivate 
                    their own green havens. Our journey is fueled by the belief that plants 
                    have the power to transform any space into a peaceful, refreshing 
                    sanctuary—and we are here to help you achieve just that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission is simple: to help you create a greener, happier home. 
                    We want to make plant care effortless and enjoyable so that everyone, 
                    no matter their experience level, can bring nature into their space. 
                    We believe that a home filled with plants is a home filled with life, 
                    and we’re here to support you every step of the way on your plant journey.
                </p>
